dune-pymor is a DUNE (http://www.dune-project.org) module which provides
low level interfaces (and default implementations) for several discretization
related DUNE classes, such as operators and vectors. It also provides
python bindings for these classes. This module is intended to be used in the
context of pyMOR (http://www.pymor.org).

New users may best try out this module by using the git supermodule
dune-pymor-demos (https://github.com/pymor/dune-pymor-demos). Experienced
DUNE users may go ahead...
